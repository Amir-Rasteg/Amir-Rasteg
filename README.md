AI Developer and XR Tinkerer
--------------------------------------------

Working on teaching myself algorithms and signal processings as I learn to decode EEG signals, as well as other various personal projects. Currently working at Neuraville on FEAGI, an open source AI framework that allows for simulation of neuronal structures based on the human brain! Excited to build the future!
